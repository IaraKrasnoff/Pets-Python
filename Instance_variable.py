### Step 1 - Define instance variables

* To create a programmatic representation of a `Pet`, begin by declaring an instance variable for each of the following properties:
  * `str name`
    * a collection of characters, representative of a name.
  * `int age`
    * an integer, representative of an age in years.
  * `PetOwner owner`
    * the owner of this `Pet`.
