"""
* Understand that `Pet` is the parent class. `Cat` and `Dog` inherit from `Pet`, and implement the `Animal` interface, via `AnimalMixin`.
* **Cat**
  * Ensure the class [Cat](pkg/Cat.py) supports all methods of `Pet` construction, successfully completing each of the method stubs in the class [CatTest](CatTest.py).
  * The mechanism by which a `Cat` speaks is by meowing; ensure a cat's `speak` method returns `meow` as a string.
* **Dog**
  * Ensure the class [Dog](pkg/Dog.py) supports all methods of `Pet` construction, successfully completing each of the method stubs in the class [DogTest](DogTest.py).
  * Note that the mechanism by which a `Dog` speaks is by barking; ensure a dog's `speak` method returns `bark` as a string.
