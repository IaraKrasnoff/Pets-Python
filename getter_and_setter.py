### Step 3 - Define getter and setter methods

* Understand that instance variables are not directly exposed outside of the class. We use getter and setter methods to retrieve and assign values, respectively, to gatekeep their contents.
* Define a [getter and setter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method#Python) for each of the instance variables declared in the `Pet` class.
  * `name() -> str`
  * `age() -> int`
  * `owner(PetOwner owner) -> None`
  * `owner() -> PetOwner`
